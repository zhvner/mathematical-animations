#### Animated Frequency Graph
An animated frequency graph is a visual representation of a periodic waveform that changes over time. In this context, a sine wave is employed to illustrate the concept. The animation shows the sine wave evolving dynamically, with each frame introducing a slight phase shift, resulting in a smooth oscillation. The animation provides a clear depiction of how the amplitude of the wave changes as it progresses through time.

#### Phase-Colored Wave
A phase-colored wave is a visually captivating representation of a periodic waveform where the color of each point corresponds to its phase in the wave cycle. As the wave progresses, the colors change, creating a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing visual effect. The phase information is often mapped to a color spectrum, such as a gradient from blue to red, where different hues represent different points in the wave cycle.


#### Animated Circle Graph 
An animated circle graph is a visual representation of a rotating circle. The animation dynamically adjusts the position of the circle in each frame, creating a smooth rotation effect. This type of animation is useful for visualizing circular motion, periodic events, or any scenario where rotation is a key element. The changing angles in each frame contribute to the perception of continuous circular movement.

#### Stochastic Branching Model:
A stochastic branching model is a representation of a dynamic process where entities proliferate and branch in a probabilistic manner. In this context, the simulation involves the emergence of new points over time. At each step, a point may either continue its trajectory or spawn new branches. The randomness in the branching process introduces variability, resulting in a diverse and branching pattern. This type of model is often used to simulate the growth of structures, such as biological organisms or fractal patterns, in a stochastic and unpredictable manner.
